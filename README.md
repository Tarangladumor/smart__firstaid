## Problem Statement
Life is  a journey with problems to solve and lessons to learn. The problems are endless, but intelligence lies in thinking of a way to conquer them so that we may not have to suffer much. The problems may be financial, social and health related. Some of them are unpredictable and that require instant actions. We want  to draw your attention towards the health complications that everyone goes through in this phase of life. It includes cuts, burns, bone and joint related injuries , infectious diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Cholera , fever etc. as well as some breathing problems like asthma etc. An instant solution such as First aid gives relief to minor or major illness, reducing the effect of it. First aid is the first and immediate assistance given to any person suffering from either a minor or serious illness.

But unfortunately, most  people are not aware of it. The death rate for the year 2022 was 7.38. The death rate increased if we compare it with 2021. One of the reasons for this increased death rate can be lack of first aid awareness among people.

## Tech Stack

Today, front-end frameworks and libraries are becoming an essential part of the modern web development stack. We created our website in the "React framework" along with "HTML" , "CSS" and "JavaScript". React.js is a front-end library that has gradually become the go-to framework for modern web development within the JavaScript community.The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by Facebook. It’s used for building interactive user interfaces and web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.In React, you develop your applications by creating reusable components that you can think of as independent Lego blocks. These components are individual pieces of a final interface, which, when assembled, form the application’s entire user interface.
